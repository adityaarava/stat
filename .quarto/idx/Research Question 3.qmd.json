It aims to provide insights into the characteristics of the dataset, including summary statistics, distributions of variables, relationships between variables, and potential patterns or trends.\n\nFirst, we will load two libraries - ggplot 2 for creating graphical visualizations and corrplot for plotting the correlation matrices. \n\nThen we will read the dataset from a csv file named obesity data and we have stored it in a variable named health data. \n\nConvert specific columns such as age, weight, and height to numeric data types.  It first coerces them into character type and then converts them into numeric type. This is often necessary when R reads these values as factors or characters instead of numeric.\n\nNow let's get the summary statistics for the dataset including minimum, maximum, mean, median, 1st quartile and 3rd quartile values for the numeric columns. \n\nCreate histograms for each numeric variable in the dataset. It plots them in a 3x3 grid using the par function, iterating over each numeric column, and plotting a histogram for each one. \n\nCreate the box plots for each numeric variable grouped by 'Obesity Levels'.  It also arranges them in a 3x3 grid similar to the histograms. \n\nCreate a scatter plot matrix for all the numeric variables in the dataset. It first filters out only numeric columns, stores them in numeric data, and then creates a scatter plot matrix using the pairs function, with points represented by filled circles (pch = 16).\n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code\"\nhealth_data <- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\arava\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\STAT515\\\\modified_obesity_data.csv\")\n\n# Select relevant features\nselected_features <- health_data[, c(\"Age\", \"Height\", \"Weight\", \"family_history_with_overweight\", \"Highcaloric_food\", \n                                     \"Vegetable_intake\", \"Main_Meal_Intake\", \"Food_between_meals\", \"Smoking_Habit\", \n                                     \"Water_intake\", \"Calorie_Intake\", \"PHYSICAL_Activity\", \"Technology_dependency\", \n                                     \"Alcohol_Consumption\", \"Mode_of_Transportation\")]\n\n# Check for missing values and handle if necessary\n# For example: selected_features <- na.omit(selected_features)\n\n# Perform feature scaling or normalization\n# Here, we'll use z-score standardization\n# Exclude non-numeric columns before scaling\nnumeric_features <- selected_features[, sapply(selected_features, is.numeric)]\n\n# Perform feature scaling\nscaled_features <- scale(numeric_features)\n\n```\n\nThe purpose of this code is to prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling by selecting relevant features, handling missing values if necessary, and standardizing numeric features through z-score standardization.
