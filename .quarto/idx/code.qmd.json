Its market capitalization is represented by the tallest bar on the chart. Entities Compared: Other entities in the chart represent a diverse range of categories, such as companies from different sectors, countries' GDPs, or other relevant categories. These entities are ranked based on their market capitalization values, with the lowest being the \"Narcos wealth\" at 44 billion USD. Comparison with Apple: Alibaba: The market capitalization of Alibaba is mentioned to be nearly half of Apple's. This indicates that while Alibaba is a significant entity, its market capitalization is substantially lower compared to Apple. Other Entities: The chart allows for the comparison of market capitalizations of various entities relative to Apple. Entities with higher market capitalizations will have taller bars, while those with lower market capitalizations will have shorter bars. Insights from the Chart: The chart provides insights into the relative market capitalizations of different entities compared to Apple. It highlights the dominance of Apple in terms of market capitalization compared to other entities. It also showcases the wide range of market capitalizations across different entities, reflecting the diversity of the global economy. Overall, the chart effectively visualizes the market capitalizations of multiple entities, with Apple as the reference point for comparison, providing valuable insights into the relative sizes of different entities in the market.\n\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ndata <- data.frame(\n  variable = c(\"Apple\", \"Africa's 25 GDP\", \"Netherlands GDP\", \"Google\", \"U.S. Dept. of Defence's Budget (2019)\",\n               \"Coca-Cola\", \"Phone Carriers\", \"NASA's Budget since 1998\", \"NASA\",\n               \"Alibaba\", \"All Cryptocurrencies\", \"Nike+Adidas\", \"Top 300 Movies\", \"Bitcoin\", \"General Motors\",'Narcos wealth'),\n  value = c(886, 839, 831, 751, 686, 678, 559, 451, 450, 416, 233, 182, 138, 138, 51,44),\n  color = c(\"red\", \"orange\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"purple\", \"brown\", \"pink\", \"grey\", \"black\", \"yellow\",\n            \"gold\", \"darkgreen\", \"violet\", \"darkred\", \"skyblue\",\"darkblue\")\n)\n\ndata <- data[order(data$value), ]\n\np <- plot_ly(data, \n             type = 'scatterpolar', \n             theta = data$variable, \n             r = data$value,\n             fill = 'toself',\n             line = list(color = data$color),\n             marker = list(color = data$color)) %>%\n  layout(title = list(text = \"Market Capitalization of several sectors against apple\", \n                      x = 0.5,  \n                      y = 0.95,  \n                      xanchor = \"center\", \n                      yanchor = \"top\"),  \n         polar = list(radialaxis = list(visible = TRUE, title = 'Value (in Billions)')),\n         margin = list(t = 100))  \n\np\n```\n\n## **Interpretation:**\n\nThe radar chart compares the market capitalization of various entities against a reference point, likely Apple, which has the highest market capitalization.
